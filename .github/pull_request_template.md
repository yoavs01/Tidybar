# Summary

A brief description of the changes proposed in this pull request.

**Scope:** This PR changes one focused thing (bug fix or feature) plus minimal plumbing. Larger refactors need prior agreement in the issue.

> **Tests:** the suite is Swift Testing throughout. Write new tests with `@Test` / `#expect`, not XCTest.
> **External contributors:** before opening a PR for a bug fix or new feature, please make sure there's a corresponding issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yoavs01/Tidybar/issues). PRs that fix or change things that haven't been reported/agreed on may be closed without review.

## Linked issue (required)

PR Metadata fails without a `Closes:` line in this exact form (keep it on its own line):

```text
Closes: N/A
```

Replace `N/A` with `#<issue_number>` (e.g. `Closes: #123`) when this PR fixes/implements a specific issue.

Closes: N/A

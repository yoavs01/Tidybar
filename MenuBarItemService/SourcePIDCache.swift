/// A cache for the source process identifiers for menu bar item windows.
///
/// We use the term "source process" to refer to the process that created
/// a menu bar item. Originally, we used the CGWindowList API to get the
/// window's owning process (`kCGWindowOwnerPID`), which was always the
/// source process. However, as of macOS 26, item windows are owned by
/// the Control Center.
///
/// We can find what we need using the Accessibility API, but doing it
/// efficiently ends up being a fairly complex process. Since calls to
/// Accessibility are thread blocking, we do most of the heavy lifting
/// in a dedicated XPC service, which we then call asynchronously from
/// the main app.
///
/// This type is an `actor`. Only the Combine observer wiring in
/// `start()` (and its backing `cancellable` lazy var) is actually
/// actor-isolated — that state had no synchronization of its own
/// before this conversion. Everything else (`state`, `scanLock`, and
/// the `CachedApplication` cache entries) was already protected by its
/// own `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, so those members and the methods that
/// only touch them are marked `nonisolated`. This preserves the exact
/// pre-actor concurrency semantics: cache-hit reads in `pidBody` can
/// still proceed without waiting on an in-flight full AX scan, and
/// `scanLock` (not actor isolation) is still what serializes full
/// scans across concurrent callers. Making these methods actor-isolated
/// instead would have serialized *all* calls — including fast
/// cache-hit checks — behind any long-running blocking AX scan, which
/// would have been a behavior change, not just a safety upgrade.

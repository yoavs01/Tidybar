/// Characterizes the divergence-persistence gate that decides whether a
/// divergence observation should trigger a saved-layout re-apply.
///
/// The bug (#723): a single divergent reading of
/// `currentLayoutDivergesFromSaved` can be transient — an app activating with
/// a wide application menu compresses or covers status items, shifting their
/// bounds for as long as the menu is up. Reading that as "items in the wrong
/// section" and immediately dispatching a bulk apply replays the whole
/// layout and yanks the cursor around for geometry that resolves itself once
/// the menu closes. The fix requires the same divergence to be observed on
/// two consecutive cache cycles before it is treated as confirmed.

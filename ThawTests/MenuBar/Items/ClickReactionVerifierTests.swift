/// Covers the two rules that decide whether an owner reacted to a click.
///
/// The polling loop around them talks to the window server and cannot run
/// here, but the rules themselves are where the mistakes live: crediting
/// an unrelated app's window, or reading an item's ordinary reflow as a
/// reaction.
///
/// Serialized because the snapshot and verification cases reach the live
/// window server through `Bridging`'s process-wide CGS main connection and
/// its shared diagnostic logger. XCTest ran this class's tests one at a
/// time; swift-testing parallelizes in-process regardless of the scheme's
/// own setting, and overlapping CGS window-list calls on that one
/// connection are not safe.

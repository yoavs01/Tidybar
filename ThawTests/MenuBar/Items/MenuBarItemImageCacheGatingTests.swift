/// capture loop feeding the SkyLight WindowServer leak (#759).
///
/// `settingsPaneHasBeenOpened` used to be a sticky flag: once the user opened
/// the layout settings pane a single time, it stayed `true` for the process
/// lifetime, and every space/screen/appearance/item-cache change from then on
/// triggered a full background capture of all sections — including offscreen
/// sections through the leaking SkyLight path — even with every Tidybar window
/// closed. `shouldAllowBackgroundCapture` now gates on whether the pane is
/// *currently* open, bounding the window in which background captures can run.

/// which decides whether a cache cycle that saw no window change still has a
/// reason to ask the service for source processes.
///
/// An item cached without one has a provisional identity: its namespace falls
/// back to the owner of its window — Control Center, for everything it hosts —
/// and its name to "Menu Bar Item". The first AX scan after login routinely
/// misses, and the item's window then never changes again, so before this the
/// bad reading survived until the next launch.

/// Characterizes the narrowing applied to the saved order by the early,
/// resolved-identities-only apply that runs during startup settling.
///
/// Without that early pass the bar sits in macOS's arrangement until every
/// sourcePID resolves, which is ~8 s on a dense bar (#881). Running early is
/// only safe because the desired order is narrowed to identifiers we can
/// currently identify: `planLCSMoveSequence` intersects current with desired,
/// so an identifier dropped here is left untouched rather than mispositioned.

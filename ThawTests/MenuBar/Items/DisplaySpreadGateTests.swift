///
/// When the active menu bar relocates to another display macOS migrates the
/// status item windows between screens asynchronously. For a window of time
/// the managed items straddle two displays: some still on the old screen,
/// some already on the new one. A bulk apply dispatched in that window
/// resolves each item's move against whichever display its window currently
/// occupies, so the moves cannot converge and leave items stranded on the
/// wrong screen, where they read as un-hidden. Persisting the section order in
/// that window bakes the transition artifact into the saved layout. Both
/// callers defer until the items collapse back onto a single display.
///
/// Frames are expressed in the global CoreGraphics coordinate space
/// (top-left origin), the same space the menu bar item bounds use, so a
/// secondary display positioned above the main one has a negative y origin.

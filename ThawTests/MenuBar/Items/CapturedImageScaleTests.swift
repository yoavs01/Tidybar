/// Covers `MenuBarItemImageCache.resolvedScale(imagePixelWidth:boundsWidth:expected:)`,
/// the check `individualCapture` was missing in #851/#736 and that
/// `compositeCapture` and `refreshImages` were still bypassing in #990.
///
/// The two composite paths used to compare an image's pixel width against
/// `bounds.width * scale` and reject a mismatch, while `individualCapture`
/// ran after that rejection as the fallback — and itself fed the bug in
/// #851/#736 by caching under an unverified scale. #990 was the remaining
/// half: on a 1x external beside a Retina display, SCK returned 2x pixels
/// for the visible strip ("expected 522.0, got 1044") and SkyLight returned
/// them for the offscreen strips ("expected 5365.0, got 10730"), so every
/// composite was rejected wholesale and the layout editor showed gray
/// placeholders. Both paths now resolve the scale the same way.

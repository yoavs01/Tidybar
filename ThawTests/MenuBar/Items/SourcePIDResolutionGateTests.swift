/// Characterizes the identity-resolution gate consulted before a saved-layout
/// bulk apply.
///
/// When the MenuBarItemService XPC connection fails, most third-party items
/// resolve to a nil sourcePID and collapse to ambiguous Control-Center-owned
/// identifiers. Dispatching the bulk apply in that state rearranges items that
/// cannot be matched to the saved layout. The gate must trip on that
/// majority-unresolved signature while tolerating the small number of system
/// items (WiFi, Clock, BentoBox) that legitimately resolve to nil.

    // NOTE: `applySavedLayout` and `applyProfileLayout` (the call sites that
    // consult this gate) are instance methods on `MenuBarItemManager` that

    // items to run — they cannot be exercised with plain fixture values the
    // way `savedLayoutSectionLookup` can (see SavedLayoutSectionLookupTests).
    // This suite is limited to characterizing the pure predicate; the
    // call-site wiring is verified structurally (grep for the call site
    // inside applySavedLayout/applyProfileLayout) rather than by unit test.

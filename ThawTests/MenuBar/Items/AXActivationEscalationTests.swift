/// Covers ``AXItemActivator/performFirstEffectiveAction(_:perform:didReact:)``,
/// the rule that decides when activating an item is allowed to try harder.
///
/// Every escalation is another activation of the same item, so escalating past
/// an action that already worked is how a menu gets opened and immediately shut:
/// `AXPress` toggles it, and the synthetic click the caller falls back to after
/// that toggles it again. The reading that makes this happen is a thrown
/// `AXShowMenu` — the action opens the menu and then blocks, because the menu
/// runs a modal tracking loop and the app cannot answer while it does, so the
/// messaging timeout expires on exactly the calls that succeeded (#924).

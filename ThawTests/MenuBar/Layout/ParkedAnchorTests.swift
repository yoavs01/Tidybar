/// #881's remaining storm on the `fec231c` build: at launch the hidden
/// section's items are parked thousands of points left of the display by the
/// control item's collapse. `planHiddenDividerAnchor` picked the first
/// desired-hidden item (e.g. `ai.elementlabs.lmstudio:Item-0` at
/// `minX=-4222`) as the anchor, the H_ctrl drag failed all 8 retries — each
/// attempt briefly brought the divider on-screen (icons disappeared/reappeared)
/// then snapped back to the parked zone — and the user saw a cursor seizure.
///
/// The fix excludes parked items from the anchor candidate set, so the
/// per-item LCS pass (which successfully repositions items one-by-one) runs
/// instead of the futile boundary move.

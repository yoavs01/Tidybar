/// #978 is a divider displaced past every item — `minX=-2742.0` on a bar
/// whose owner kept arranging items — that never recovered, because the
/// recovery read "parked" off the leading edge alone. That test cannot
/// distinguish a stranded divider from a healthy collapsed one: hiding a
/// section expands H_ctrl into an offscreen-reaching spacer, so every
/// normal collapsed bar fails the leading-edge check. These tests pin the
/// both-edges semantics the recovery now uses, against the same display
/// geometry as ``ParkedDividerLog``.

/// Characterizes the re-entrancy guard on `resetLayoutToFreshState()`.
///
/// Before this fix, `resetLayoutToFreshState` had no re-entrancy guard: a
/// second concurrent invocation would overwrite the single background-cache
/// continuation slot, permanently stranding the first invocation's `await`.
/// Because the first invocation's `defer { isResettingLayout = false }` never
/// ran, `isResettingLayout` stayed `true` for the rest of the session, which
/// silently disabled `shouldPersistSavedOrder` (see `LayoutSolver.swift`) —
/// the user could rearrange the menu bar and nothing would ever be saved.
///
/// Driving a full reset through the window server is impractical in a unit
/// test, so these tests set `isResettingLayout` directly and assert on the
/// guard's observable behavior rather than exercising the real reset body.
/// Serialized: each test builds a live `MenuBarItemManager`, whose reset path
/// reaches the process-wide diagnostic logger, and the `await` inside the
/// rejected reset would otherwise let two managers interleave on the main
/// actor.

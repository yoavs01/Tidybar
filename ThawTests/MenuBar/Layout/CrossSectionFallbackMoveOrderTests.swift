/// Tests for LayoutSolver.crossSectionFallbackMoveOrder.
///
/// The per-item fallback in applyProfileLayout drags every item that still
/// needs to cross the hidden to always-hidden boundary onto one anchor, the
/// always-hidden divider. The landing slot is therefore the same for every
/// move in the run, and each move displaces its predecessors one place
/// further from the divider. The order the moves are issued in is the order
/// the items come to rest in, reversed.
///
/// The failure this locks down is quiet. A reversed run leaves every item in
/// the section the profile asked for, so the cross-section tallies, the
/// divider gates and the saved order all read as correct; only the order the
/// user sees when the section is revealed is backwards. With
/// enforceConcealedSectionOrder off, relaxConcealedSectionOrder then rewrites
/// the desired sequence to match, so the LCS plans nothing and the apply
/// reports success over a visibly backwards bar.

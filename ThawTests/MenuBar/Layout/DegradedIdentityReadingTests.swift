/// bar-wide `kCGWindowName` degradation from reaching the cache.
///
/// #881's 12:38 log read the live hidden section as
/// `com.rogueamoeba.soundsource:com.rogueamoeba.soundsource` and ten more of
/// the same shape, Tidybar's own control item among them, two minutes after the
/// same items had read normally. Caching that reading persists the whole bar
/// under a second set of identifiers, and every later flip between the two
/// spellings presents a bar's worth of late arrivals — a re-sort, a bulk apply,
/// posted moves, a captured cursor. The reporter's unenacted-move streak
/// reached nine.
///
/// The cost of a false positive is one skipped cache cycle, so these tests
/// mostly pin the cases that must *not* trip it.

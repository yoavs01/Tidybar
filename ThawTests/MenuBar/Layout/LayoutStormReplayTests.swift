/// shape a reporter's machine was actually in when the storm fired, so the

/// The bug was never in how the planner ordered items — it was that a second
/// planner existed. On notched displays `applyProfileLayout` took a full-sort
/// path that re-inserted items one at a time and trimmed its replay by the
/// longest correctly ordered *prefix*, so a single item arriving out of place
/// near the front of the row invalidated the trim and replayed everything
/// after it. These tests characterize the gap between the two.

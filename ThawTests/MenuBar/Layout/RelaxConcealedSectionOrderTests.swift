/// The relaxation exists because a move costs the same whether or not its
/// result can be seen: the cursor is hijacked, a drag is synthesised, the
/// landing is polled. Reordering items parked thousands of points
/// off-screen spends that cost on something the Tidybar Bar renders from the
/// cache anyway. Rewriting the *desired* sequence — rather than filtering
/// the planned moves — is what makes the saving safe: the LCS then sees
/// those items as already in place, so no surviving move is left anchored
/// against an item the plan assumed had shifted.
///
/// Membership is never surrendered, only intra-section order.

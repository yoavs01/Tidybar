/// The guard was added by ff7517f7 to stop a user breaking their menu bar by
/// dragging a chevron. It cannot do that — AppKit writes
/// `NSStatusItem Preferred Position <autosaveName>` itself, never through
/// `ControlItemDefaults` — so it only ever blocked Tidybar's own writes,
/// including the seeding the very same commit introduced.
/// Serialized and run against a scratch defaults suite: these cases write
/// real `NSStatusItem Preferred Position` keys, and `Defaults.store` is
/// process-wide, so without both a run would clobber the divider positions of
/// whoever is running the tests.

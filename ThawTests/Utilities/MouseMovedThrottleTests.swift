/// gate that replaced a count-based "process every 5th event" throttle.

/// The count-based version scaled its effective processed-event rate with
/// the input device's polling rate, so a 1000 Hz mouse did roughly 8x the
/// work of a 125 Hz mouse for identical physical motion. These tests pin
/// the replacement's actual contract: the processed-event rate is bounded
/// by wall-clock time, not by how many events the device delivers.

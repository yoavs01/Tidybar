/// Covers ``ObjectStorage``, the Objective-C associated-object wrapper used to
/// hang extra state off framework classes the app does not own.
///
/// Two properties carry the weight here and neither is visible from a call
/// site. The first is key identity: the lookup key is the storage instance's
/// own address, so two storages of the same `Value` type must not read each
/// other's entries — if that ever regressed, unrelated pieces of the app would
/// silently share a slot. The second is the strong/weak split: `set(_:for:)`
/// retains, `weakSet(_:for:)` boxes the value in a private `WeakReference` so
/// the association does not extend the value's lifetime. Both are lifetime
/// behavior, so the tests assert through `weak var` observers rather than
/// through the returned values.

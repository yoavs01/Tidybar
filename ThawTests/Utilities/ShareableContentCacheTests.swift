/// once it has elapsed, concurrent callers joining one in-flight fetch, and
/// one caller's cancellation not poisoning another's result.

/// Serialized because every case here measures real elapsed time against
/// short `maxAge` budgets. Run concurrently the cases contend for the same
/// executor and the timings stop being reliable, so the suite is kept to one
/// case at a time as it was under XCTest.

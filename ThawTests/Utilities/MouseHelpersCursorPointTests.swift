/// point that lies on no display to the leftmost edge of one, which sits under
/// the Apple menu. Hidden and always-hidden items on a notched display sit at
/// negative X while they are offscreen, so a helper that answered with a point
/// unconditionally would drag the pointer under the Apple menu on exactly the

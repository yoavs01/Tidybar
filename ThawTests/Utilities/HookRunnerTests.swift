/// Covers `HookRunner`, which launches user-supplied profile-apply scripts.
///
/// Every case here runs a real subprocess against a script written into a
/// per-test temporary directory. That is deliberate: the interesting
/// behavior — the executable-bit check, the osascript routing, the context
/// environment, the timeout race — only exists at the process boundary, and
/// a fake would assert nothing about it. `osascriptPath` is injected so the
/// AppleScript route can be exercised without depending on a real
/// interpreter or on `.scpt` compilation.

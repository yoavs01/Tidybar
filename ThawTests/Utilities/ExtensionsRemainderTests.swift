///
/// Between them the sibling suites already drive `Bundle`, the `MenuBarItem`

/// the `Publisher` operators, the interface-theme notification name,
/// `NSBezierPath`, `NSImage`, `NSApplication`, `NSPanel`, transparency
/// trimming, `detachedCopy`, and the happy paths of `averageColor` and
/// `isTransparent`. What none of them reach is:
///
/// - **The alpha-offset table in `isTransparent`.** The fast path reads one
///   byte per pixel out of the image's own buffer, and which byte that is
///   depends on the alpha position *and* the byte order. Only one of the
///   eight combinations — premultiplied-first little-endian, what a screen
///   capture produces — is exercised anywhere else, and it happens to be the
///   one every other suite's fixture uses. A transposed row in that table
///   would make Tidybar read a color channel as if it were alpha and silently
///   throw away, or silently cache, the wrong menu bar item images.
/// - **The two fallbacks out of the fast path**: a pixel format that is not
///   32-bit, and an alpha format with no alpha channel at all.
/// - **`averageColor`'s color space resolution**, both the fall-through to
///   Display P3 when neither the argument nor the image offers an RGB space,
///   and the refusal when the resolved space cannot back an 8-bit context.
/// - **`CGColor.brightness`'s `nil` branch**, which `ExtensionsGraphicsTests`
///   records as unreachable. It is reachable — through a pattern color, the
///   one kind of color that has no numeric components to convert.
///
/// Deliberately **not** covered here:
///
/// - Every `NSScreen` member. The block is by far the largest uncovered
///   region left in the file, and all of it either reads the number,
///   arrangement, or notch status of the attached displays, calls into
///   `Bridging` or the Accessibility API, or mutates the process-global
///   display caches the running host app shares. None of it can be asserted
///   deterministically from a unit test.
/// - `NSStatusItem.showMenu(_:)`, which runs a modal menu tracking loop.
/// - `NSPanel.waitForInvisibleWithKVO`'s cancellation arm, which is only
///   reachable behind a panel that has actually been ordered in.
/// - Four refusals that no fixture can produce: the `@unknown default` arms;
///   the `alphaOnly` row of the offset table (Core Graphics rejects a 32-bit
///   `alphaOnly` image outright, so the guard above it can never be passed);
///   the short-buffer guard (an image whose provider is smaller than its own
///   geometry is likewise rejected at creation); and the two "context could

/// Regression lock for `ProfileManager.deleteProfile(id:)` when the
/// profile's on-disk JSON file is already missing.
///
/// The bug: `deleteProfile` removed the file before updating the in-memory
/// `profiles` list. `FileManager.removeItem` throws when the file is
/// already gone (out-of-band deletion, cloud-sync churn, a previous
/// partially-failed delete), which meant the manifest entry was never
/// cleaned up, leaving the profile stuck in the UI forever — and every
/// subsequent delete attempt failed the same way.
///
/// These tests drive the real `ProfileManager` against an injected
/// temporary profiles directory, never the user's real profile folder.
///
/// Serialized to match `ProfileManagerCRUDTests`: both drive a real
/// `ProfileManager` on the main actor over on-disk state.

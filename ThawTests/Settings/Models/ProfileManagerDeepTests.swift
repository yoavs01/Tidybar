/// Covers the ``ProfileManager`` failure paths that the existing suites step
/// around: the two `do`/`catch` blocks that swallow an I/O error rather than
/// propagating it (`ensureDirectoryExists`, `saveManifest`), and the
/// already-active short circuit in `applyFocusFilterProfile`.
///
/// `ProfileManagerPersistenceTests` reaches the *corrupt manifest* and
/// *occupied directory path* cases, but neither of those enters a catch block:
/// a file sitting at the profiles-directory path makes `fileExists` return
/// true, so `createDirectory` is never called. The cases here put a regular
/// file at a *parent* component instead, so the directory genuinely cannot be
/// created, and park a directory on the manifest path so the manifest write
/// genuinely fails.
///
/// Every failure case asserts through a *second* `ProfileManager` over the same
/// directory. That reload is what proves the swallowed write really failed
/// rather than quietly succeeding — an in-memory assertion alone would pass
/// either way.
///
/// Deliberate gaps, all of which need a live `AppState` that tests cannot
/// stand up: `performSetup(with:)`, `saveProfile(name:from:)`,
/// `applyProfile(_:to:previousProfileID:)` and its layout task,
/// `applySnapshot(_:to:)`, `updateProfileWithCurrentState(id:appState:)`,
/// `updateProfile(id:scope:appState:)`, `updateProfileConfiguration(id:appState:)`,
/// `applyCurrentConfiguration(to:from:)`, `rebuildProfileHotkeys()` past its
/// `appState` guard, `checkDisplayAndAutoSwitch()`,
/// `handleFocusFilterDeactivated()`, `applyProfileForDisplay(uuid:)`, and the
/// bodies of `reapplyActiveProfile()` and `applyFocusFilterProfile()` that run
/// once an app state exists. `captureCurrentLayout`'s item-section inversion is
/// unreachable too, for a different reason: it iterates
/// `MenuBarItemManager.computeSectionOrder(from:)`, whose two inputs
/// (`itemCache` and `savedSectionOrder`) are both private and only populated by
/// that manager's own `performSetup(with:)`.

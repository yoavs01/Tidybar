/// Covers ``ThawFocusFilter`` and ``ProfileEntityQuery``, the App Intents
/// surface that lets a macOS Focus mode switch Tidybar's menu bar profile.
///
/// `ProfileEntityTests` already covers ``ProfileEntity``'s identity and type
/// display representation. What was untested is everything the system actually
/// invokes: the filter's `perform()` and the query that populates the profile
/// picker in System Settings.
///
/// `perform()` has exactly one durable side effect — the
/// `FocusFilterRequestedProfileID` default — and one volatile one, a
/// `DistributedNotificationCenter` post. Only the first is asserted here.
/// Distributed notifications cross process boundaries and are delivered on a
/// run loop the test cannot join, so treating delivery as a postcondition would
/// make these cases flaky; `ProfileManagerPersistenceTests` covers the
/// receiving half by writing the same key directly. The post still happens, and
/// is harmless: nothing in the test process subscribes to it.
///
/// The key is written through `Defaults.store`, so every case that performs the
/// filter runs inside `withScratchDefaults`, whose async overload serializes
/// the store swap process-wide. The suite stays `.serialized` because the
/// metadata and default-query cases read `nonisolated(unsafe) static var`s.
///
/// Deliberate gap: `ProfileEntityQuery.allProfiles()` hardcodes
/// `FileManager.default.urls(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, …)` plus
/// `"Tidybar/Profiles/profiles.json"` and offers no injection point, unlike
/// `ProfileManager(profilesDirectory:)`. Its result therefore depends on
/// whether the machine running the tests has real Tidybar profiles, and seeding
/// them would mean writing into the developer's own Application Support. The
/// cases below only assert invariants that hold for both an empty and a
/// populated manifest; a seam is needed to do better.

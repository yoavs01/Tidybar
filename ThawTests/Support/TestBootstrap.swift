/// Points the process-wide `Defaults` facade at a scratch suite so no
/// suite can write to the real `com.yoavsror.tidybar` domain of whoever is
/// running the tests. Suites using `withScratchDefaults` compose with
/// this unchanged: they swap in their own per-test suite and restore the
/// previous store, which is now this scratch base rather than
/// `.standard`. Suites that call `Defaults.set` directly no longer need
/// per-key snapshot/restore to be safe, though existing ones stay
/// correct.
///
/// The app host has already launched and read its state from the real
/// domain by the time the test bundle loads; only reads and writes made
/// from test code are redirected.

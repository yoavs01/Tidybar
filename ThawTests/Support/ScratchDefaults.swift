/// `Defaults.store` is a single global. `.serialized` orders tests *within* a
/// suite, not across suites, so without this two suites could install scratch
/// stores concurrently and each would read the other's. The lock makes the
/// swap window mutually exclusive.
///
/// - Note: this protects suites that go through the synchronous
///   `withScratchDefaults`; the async variant serializes through
///   ``ScratchDefaultsMutex`` instead. A suite that reads the real `Defaults`
///   domain without taking the lock can still observe someone else's scratch
///   store. The end state is for every `Defaults`-touching suite to route
///   through here.

/// async variant suspends on this actor-backed mutex instead and holds it for
/// the whole body, suspensions included. Waiters resume in FIFO order, and
/// `release()` hands the mutex to the next waiter without ever letting a
/// third party sneak in between.
///
/// - Warning: like the unfair lock, this mutex is non-recursive: a nested
///   acquisition waits on itself forever. It is also independent of
///   `scratchDefaultsLock`, so a synchronous and an asynchronous caller do
///   not exclude each other.

/// `MenuBarItem.customName`, `MigrationManager`, `HookScript.saveGlobal` --
/// writes through the `Defaults` facade. Without a scratch store those writes
/// land in the real `com.yoavsror.tidybar` domain and mutate the defaults of
/// whoever runs the suite.
///
/// This replaces the per-key snapshot/restore that `GeneralSettingsTests` and
/// `AdvancedSettingsTests` had to do by hand. Those worked, but they could
/// only protect keys they knew about, and their own doc comments flag that the
/// approach is unsound once suites run concurrently.
///
/// - Important: `Defaults.store` is process-wide. A suite calling this **must**
///   be `.serialized`, otherwise a sibling test running in parallel will read
///   through this suite's scratch store. Serialization scopes execution within
///   a suite, so a `.serialized` suite is safe even though the store is global.
///
/// - Warning: `scratchDefaultsLock` is non-recursive. A nested
///   `withScratchDefaults` call on the same thread — that is, from inside
///   `body` — is unsupported and will deadlock.

/// Covers ``Hotkey`` itself — construction, the enable/disable pair, the
/// change announcement, and value equality — without an `AppState`.
///
/// `Hotkey`'s private `Listener` has a failable initializer that returns `nil`
/// unless the hotkey has *both* an app state and a key combination, and only an
/// app state can supply the `HotkeyRegistry` it would register with. So without
/// `performSetup(with:)` the hotkey can never become enabled — which is exactly
/// what makes the rest of the type testable: `enable()` runs end to end and
/// touches nothing global, so every path around it can be driven safely.
///
/// The load-bearing behaviour here is the `keyCombination` `didSet`. It calls
/// `enable()` and then `keyCombinationDidChange?()`, and three owners —
/// `HotkeysSettings`, `MenuBarManager`, and `ProfileManager` — persist the
/// binding from inside that callback. Two properties of it are relied on and
/// otherwise unverified:
///
/// - The value passed to `init` is **not** announced. All three owners set the
///   loaded binding first and install the callback second, precisely so the
///   value just read back off disk is not written straight out again. That
///   ordering is a comment in three files and an assertion in none.
/// - Every later assignment announces **exactly once**, with the new value
///   already stored, including an assignment of `nil`. `HotkeysSettings` reads
///   `hotkey.keyCombination` from inside the callback to decide between writing
///   the binding and deleting the dictionary entry, so a callback that fired
///   before the store, or twice, would either persist the stale binding or
///   leave a dead entry behind.
///
/// Deliberately **not** covered: `performSetup(with:)`, the registration inside
/// `Listener.init`, the action-dispatch closure it installs, and
/// `Listener.invalidate()`. All four need a live `AppState` — and the dispatch
/// closure additionally reaches into `ProfileManager` and `MenuBarManager` — so
/// none can be reached from a unit test. `isEnabled` is therefore asserted only
/// in its `false` state, which is the honest one for a hotkey with no app.

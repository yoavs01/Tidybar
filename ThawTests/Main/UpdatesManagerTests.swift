/// The alert tells the user that a build for their macOS arrives through the
/// alpha channel, then starts a check for it. Sparkle says nothing when a
/// background check finds nothing, so the promise is tracked across the check
/// and answered with the releases page when the feed comes back empty. These
/// tests stand in for the check: they drive the outcomes Sparkle would report.
///

/// channel writes real preference keys through the process-wide

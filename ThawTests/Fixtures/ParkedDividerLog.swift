/// The two menu bar shapes the #899 field log alternated between while the
/// boundary move storm ran.

/// Reporter: single notched MacBook Pro (`screen.maxX=2056`, notch
/// `918…1138`, right boundary 1985), macOS 26.6.1 build 25G76, Tidybar
/// 2.0.0-rc.2.1 (49) commit `54345d40`, log `thaw_2026-08-09_18-14-12.log`.
///
/// The log covers 22 seconds and never converges. `Profile re-sort` fires
/// seven times, and the hidden section's membership alternates 4 → 0 → 4
/// with `hiddenBoundaryMismatch` alternating 5 → 9 → 5. Every pass tries to
/// drag `H_ctrl` next to coconutBattery, every pass burns all eight attempts
/// on `EventError.cannotComplete`, and the per-item pass that follows flips
/// the membership back so the next re-sort has the same work to do. It ends
/// only because the reporter killed the app.
///
/// The two states fail for different reasons, which is why #881's anchor
/// filter alone does not close the loop:
///
/// - ``anchorParked``: both the anchor and the divider sit in the parked
///   zone. `planHiddenDividerAnchor` rejects the anchor, so no drag is
///   planned. Covered by ``ParkedAnchorTests``.
/// - ``anchorOnScreen``: the anchor is back on the bar at `minX=1050`, so it
///   survives the anchor filter, but `H_ctrl` is still parked at
///   `minX=-3950`. The drag point is on screen and the owner accepts the
///   events, yet AppKit snaps the divider back on mouse-up and the attempt
///   reports "events succeeded but item not at destination".

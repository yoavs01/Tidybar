/// Pins the extras-menu-bar negative-cache TTL ladder.
///
/// The regression this ladder fixes: the per-app "checked, no extras menu
/// bar" flag was cleared on every cache cleanup, and cleanup is driven by
/// `NSWorkspace.runningApplications` — which changes whenever any process on
/// the system starts or exits. A field log (#956) showed cleanup running 46
/// times in seven minutes, so nearly every full scan re-probed all ~170
/// running applications over the Accessibility API even though only ~16 of
/// them have an extras menu bar at all. Deadlines make the skip survive
/// cleanup; the ladder is what keeps late-registered status items findable.

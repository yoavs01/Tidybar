/// service's `Listener` and the app's `MenuBarItemServiceConnection` consult
/// to decide whether a same-team peer requirement can ever be satisfied.

/// The concrete identifier depends on how the binary under test was signed —
/// a Developer ID build reports a team, an ad-hoc CI build reports `nil` —
/// so the assertions cover the contract that holds either way: the lookup
/// must not trap, must be stable across reads, and must never produce an
/// empty or malformed team string.

/// Covers the halves of ``WindowInfo`` that survive without a window server:
/// the memberwise initializer, the *refusal* side of the synthesized `Codable`
/// conformance, and the derived properties that the menu-bar rules read.
///
/// `WindowInfoTests` already covers the happy path — an encode/decode round
/// trip, every field's contribution to `==`, hashing of equal values, and the
/// three window levels `isMenuRelated` names outright. This suite deliberately
/// starts where that one stops:
///
/// - **Decoding refusals.** A `WindowInfo` is persisted and replayed (menu-bar
///   item caches, failure ledgers, diagnostic captures), so a truncated or
///   wrongly typed payload has to fail loudly rather than decode into a window
///   with a plausible-looking zero rect. `bounds` is the interesting one: it is
///   a `CGRect`, which encodes as the nested unkeyed pair `[[x, y], [w, h]]`
///   and whose decoder reads positionally, so arity is the only thing standing
///   between a short payload and a silent misread.
/// - **The memberwise initializer's defaults**, which exist purely so the rules
///   below can be exercised without a live window, and which nothing else
///   asserts.
/// - **`isMenuRelated`'s off-by-one arm.** The rule accepts the pop-up menu
///   level *and the level one below it*; nothing currently distinguishes that
///   arm, and `isMenuRelatedForWindowServer` in the sibling suite happens to
///   use layer 25 — the status level — so it passes whether or not the
///   Window-Server arm exists at all.
///
/// Deliberately **not** covered, and not coverable here:
///
/// - `createWindows(from:)`, `createWindows(option:)`, `createMenuBarWindows`,
///   `init?(windowID:)` and `currentBounds()`. All four go through `Bridging`
///   to the live window server; their answers depend on what is on screen.
/// - `init?(dictionary:)`, which is `private` and only ever reached from those
///   enumeration functions.
/// - `wallpaperWindow(from:for:)` and `menuBarWindow(from:for:)`. Both close
///   over `CGDisplayBounds(display)`, which answers with a real display's frame
///   on any machine that has one, so neither a match nor a non-match can be
///   arranged deterministically — a test would assert the developer's monitor
///   layout rather than the code.

/// Covers the parts of `Shared/Utilities/WindowInfo.swift` that answer
/// without a window server: the two selection rules, and the enumeration
/// paths that refuse before they ever reach one.
///
/// `WindowInfoTests` covers the `Codable` round trip, each field's
/// contribution to `==` and to hashing, and three of the window levels
/// `isMenuRelated` names. `WindowInfoDecodingTests` covers the memberwise
/// initializer, the decoder's refusals, and the derived menu-bar rules
/// including the off-by-one arm. Neither touches the lookups below, which
/// both sibling suites record as uncoverable because they close over
/// `CGDisplayBounds`.
///
/// They are coverable, with one device. `CGDisplayBounds` reports an *empty*
/// rect for a display identifier that does not exist, and `CGRect` counts an
/// empty rect as containing the empty rect. So a window with zero bounds
/// satisfies the containment clause of both rules on any machine, which
/// frees the remaining clauses — the ones that actually encode what a menu
/// bar or wallpaper window looks like — to be asserted one at a time. A
/// window with real bounds satisfies none of them, which pins the
/// containment clause itself. Nothing here reads the real display list.
///
/// This matters because `menuBarWindow(from:for:)` is how
/// `NSScreen.getMenuBarHeight()` finds the window it measures, and that
/// height decides where every managed status item is placed. A rule that
/// dropped a clause would start matching some other Window Server window and
/// hand back a plausible but wrong height.
///
/// Deliberately **not** covered:
///
/// - `createWindows(option:)`, `createMenuBarWindows(option:)`, and the
///   description-decoding half of `createWindows(from:)`. All three ask the
///   window server what exists, so their answers are whatever happens to be
///   on screen.
/// - `init?(dictionary:)`, which is `private` and only ever reached from
///   those enumeration paths.
/// - `currentBounds()`, which is a single `Bridging` call.
/// - The success arm of `init?(windowID:)`, which needs a window that really
///   exists.
/// - The Dock-owned arm of `wallpaperWindow(from:for:)`. Satisfying it needs
///   a window owned by a running Dock, which is exactly the sort of thing a
///   unit test must not depend on. The clause is pinned from the other side
///   instead, by a window owned by a real application that is not the Dock.

/// Detects whether Mission Control or App Exposé is currently active.
///
/// Detection works by polling the on-screen position of a tiny, invisible
/// probe window against the position it was created at ("at rest"). When
/// Mission Control activates, the window server displaces every window on
/// screen — including ours — to arrange it in the Mission Control grid.
/// AppKit's own `frame` does not reflect that displacement (the window
/// server moves the window without telling AppKit), so the actual bounds
/// have to be queried directly through `Bridging.getWindowBounds(for:)`.
///
/// One probe window is enough for the whole app: Mission Control displaces
/// every on-screen window together, so a single representative window is
/// sufficient to detect it for all menu bar overlay panels. This assumption
/// has not been verified against multi-display Mission Control behavior
/// (Steps 4–5 of plan 009 were not run in this environment because they
/// require launching the app). If independent per-display displacement is
/// ever observed, this detector should probe one window per screen instead.
///
/// ## Known limitation: display changes while Mission Control is open
///
/// `didChangeScreenParametersNotification` clears `probeAtRestOrigin` so the
/// baseline gets re-latched, but re-latching just adopts whatever origin the
/// next `tick()` observes. If a display reconfiguration happens *while*
/// Mission Control is open, that tick latches the **displaced** position as
/// "at rest". Mission Control then exits, the probe returns to its true
/// resting position, and the detector reads that as displacement — a
/// false-positive `isActive` that persists until the next display change.
/// This is much narrower than the Step 1 bug (which never re-latched at
/// all, so it stayed wedged forever), but it's real and worth knowing about.
/// The likely root fix is to stop sampling a baseline entirely and instead
/// compare the probe window's actual bounds against its own AppKit
/// `frame.origin`, which per this type's own premise never moves under
/// Mission Control. That requires a coordinate-space conversion —
/// `Bridging.getWindowBounds` is top-left origin (window server/Core
/// Graphics), `NSWindow.frame` is bottom-left origin (AppKit) — and can't be
/// validated without running the app, so it's out of scope here.

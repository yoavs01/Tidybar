// MARK: - StaleIdentifierLedger

/// The record of which saved identifiers have stopped corresponding to
/// anything on the bar, so that a layout can eventually stop planning
/// against them.
///
/// A saved order accumulates identifiers and never sheds them. That is
/// deliberate for the common case: `planSectionOrder` merges entries for
/// apps that are merely closed, because forgetting them would send an app
/// back to `NewItemsPlacement` the next time it launched instead of the
/// slot the user put it in. So "no live item matches this identifier"
/// cannot, on its own, mean the identifier is dead.
///
/// It stops being deliberate when the identity itself is gone. An app that
/// changes its bundle identifier — #899's reporter carried
/// `de.simon.RAMTamer` alongside `de.simon.ramtamer`, and the same pair for
/// JuicyFlow — leaves an entry behind that no future item can ever match,
/// because nothing anywhere records that one bundle identifier superseded
/// another. Canonicalization does not merge them either: it only rewrites
/// the volatile-title owners, so the two spellings stay distinct forever.
///
/// Such an entry costs nothing at move-planning time — the apply filters the
/// desired sequence down to identifiers that are actually on the bar, so a
/// dead one is simply skipped and never becomes an unenacted move. What it
/// costs is *position*. ``LayoutSolver/savedPositionByBaseID(for:in:)``
/// answers with an index into the saved array, and every dead entry ahead of
/// a live one inflates that index. An app that returns to the bar is then
/// placed further right than the user left it, by exactly the number of
/// ghosts in front of it — and because nothing ever removes them, the drift
/// only grows.
///
/// The only signal that separates the two cases is repetition. A closed app
/// comes back; a retired identity does not. This ledger counts consecutive
/// applies in which an identifier was planned and went unmatched, and names
/// the ones that have run out of excuses.
///
/// It never deletes anything. Retirement means "stop counting it when
/// resolving saved positions", which leaves the entry in the user's saved
/// order and in their profile file, and lets one live match undo the verdict
/// at any time. That matters because the verdict can be wrong: an item whose
/// owner Tidybar cannot yet attribute — Little Snitch's agent before its marker
/// window appears — is indistinguishable from a rename here. Retiring it
/// costs nothing, because it is unplaceable either way, and the moment the
/// marker resolves the identifier matches again and the count is cleared.

/// The persisted half of a layout reset, runnable before the app builds a
/// menu bar.
///
/// ``MenuBarItemManager/resetLayoutToFreshState()`` — the Settings pane's
/// reset — does this plus the live half: re-seating items, re-caching, and
/// ending the settling window. That needs a running `AppState`, and it
/// throws `LayoutResetError.missingAppState` without one.
///
/// The failure this exists for is the one where that is no help. A parked
/// divider persists as an `NSStatusItem Preferred Position` and is restored
/// on the next launch, so a bar wrecked badly enough comes back wrecked and
/// starts moving items — and the pointer — before the user can reach
/// Settings. #899's reporter had to kill Tidybar from a terminal; this lets
/// them repair the bar from the same terminal, before starting it again:
///
///     /Applications/Tidybar.app/Contents/MacOS/Tidybar --reset-layout
///
/// Only `UserDefaults` is touched, so it is safe to run with the app not
/// running, and pointless to run while it is (the live manager holds the
/// same state in memory and will persist it back).

    /// placement, and the stale-identifier retirement verdicts. Removed

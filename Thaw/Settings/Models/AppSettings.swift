/// Top-level model for the app's settings.
///
/// Now that its four children (`advanced`, `general`, `hotkeys`,
/// `displaySettings`) are `@Observable`, `AppSettings` itself is
/// `@Observable` too, with plain `let` children. The previous
/// `objectWillChange` forwarding block (each child's `objectWillChange`
/// re-published into this object's own `objectWillChange`) is gone: it
/// only existed to bridge each child's `ObservableObject` conformance up
/// through `AppSettings`. Views that read through an `@Observable`
/// `AppSettings` reference (or, transitively, through `AppState`) now have
/// their reads tracked directly on whichever child's property they access —
/// see `AppState`'s note on this for the one caveat.

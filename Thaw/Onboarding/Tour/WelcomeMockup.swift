/// orbits.
///
/// These are SF Symbol stand-ins rather than real menu bar app icons: on
/// current macOS, individual status items no longer show up as separate
/// windows in `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` (the whole bar is one composited
/// surface), so the permission-free discovery path doesn't actually return
/// per-app icons here. Getting the real ones back would need Accessibility
/// permission and `AXUIElement` introspection instead.
///
/// Note: "bluetooth" is deliberately not in this list — it isn't a real SF
/// Symbol (Apple doesn't ship a Bluetooth glyph, likely a trademark reason),
/// so `Image(systemName: "bluetooth")` silently renders nothing.
